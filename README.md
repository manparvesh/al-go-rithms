# Al-[GO](https://golang.org/)-rithms [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/manparvesh/al-go-rithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/manparvesh/al-go-rithms)
Implementations of data structures and algorithms in [Golang](https://golang.org/).  

This branch contains go scripts for generating data for testing the algorithms

### List of scripts
 - random_number_list_generator.go - to generate 100,000 random integers and save them in a text file.
 - next_permutation_test_data.cpp - to generate arrays of random lengths, with random integers and find their next_permutation
